Background:
Primary U.S. interstate highways are numbered 1-99.
Odd numbers (like the 5 or 95) go north/south, and evens
(like the 10 or 90) go east/west. Auxiliary highways are
numbered 100-999, and service the primary highway indicated
by the rightmost two digits. Thus, I-405 services I-5, and
I-290 services I-90.

#Given a highway number, indicate whether it is a primary or auxiliary highway.

#If auxiliary, indicate what primary highway it serves.

#Also indicate if the (primary) highway runs north/south or east/west.
